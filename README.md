# Project-ABG-Motors-Market-Analysis
ABG Motors, a successful Japanese car manufacturer, is exploring the potential of entering the Indian market. The company believes that India's market conditions are similar to those of Japan, but it wants to validate this assumption using data-driven insights.

This project involves analyzing customer and market data from two major cities—one in Japan and one in India—to identify sales patterns and estimate potential car buyers. The key objectives include:

1.Building a Classification Model to predict customer purchase behavior based on the Japanese dataset.
2.Evaluating Market Trends by comparing income distribution, customer demographics, and other key factors.
3.Forecasting Potential Sales in India using insights from the Japanese market.
4.Visualizing Key Findings in Tableau to provide a clear business interpretation.
5.The ultimate goal is to determine whether ABG Motors can achieve a minimum of 12,000 car sales annually in India, making market entry profitable.
